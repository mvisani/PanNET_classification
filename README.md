# PanNET classification
Random Forest algorithm pipeline for classification of PanNETs. 

In this repository, we tried to reproduce the work done by *Capper et al.* (http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature26000) but for classification of 
Panceratic Neuro Endocrine Tumors (PanNETs). We mainly based our scripts from https://github.com/mwsill/mnp_training and adapted them to our data. 

The scripts are not reproducible for now. Ideally they should be adapated in order to create a pipeline for training and testing other data. In the future, it 
could be great to also reproduce this work in Python with the `sckit-learn` package. For now everything is in R. 

# On this repo
File `043_panet_classification_summary.Rmd` should be ignored. It used to be the main script but we change it to multiple small R scripts. It has not been updated since. 

# Results
Results can be seen from the two html files: `043_panet_classification_5_classes_summary.html` and `043_panet_classification_5_classes_summary.html`. 

`043_panet_classification_5_classes_summary.html` should be read first.
